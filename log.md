# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Setup vs code and got started with github integration. Also re-wrote some javascript to chage the color background of a page in response to a click event. 

**Thoughts:** Syntax and remembering the commands will be the biggest hurdle. I remembered using [] to define arrays but I don't recall using const before variables. Maybe it's been too long. Maybe I'm just too used to VEX

### Day 1: January 9 2022 

**Today's Progress**: 
Javascript: created a farenheit to celsius calculator from scratch.
Houdini: learned new Karma ROP. Learned scene import to Solaris. Opted to render in old ROP context for now. Cached fluid sim to disk. Saved sim with skin as file cache. Multiple cache deletions and restarts. Removed deprecated principled shaders and replaced with materialX standard surface shaders. Still caching, not ready to render. May try XPU for look dev tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** 
Javascript: As it always goes with code, it's the small things that get you stuck. I kept getting NaN when clicking the submit button but couldn't figure out why. It turns out I needed to tell it specifically what to get with document.getElementById("degreesF").value. It was the .value that brought it all together.

Houdini: thoughts? I'm ready to be done with these huge cache files and endless ROP shit 8 and focus on modeling and real-time in UE5. It is nice that Karma is production ready though.

### Day 2: January 10 2022 

**Today's Progress**: 
Started calculator project. Got hung up on some new CSS I'm not familiar with. Setup HTML and working through CSS grid styling for calculator. Also looked into Swift playgrounds on the iPad but decided to stay focused on Javascript for now. Watched an overview on the structure of javascript and learned about some updated syntax since I last studied it
**Thoughts:** 
Today was kind of a day off anyway but I'm more behind than I thought I was in terms of new functionality in CSS and new syntax in Javascript. Also, Still struggling with git. I think I need to sit down with a full video or something just on using git and what all the terms mean
