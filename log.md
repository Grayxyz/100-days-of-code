# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Setup vs code and got started with github integration. Also re-wrote some javascript to chage the color background of a page in response to a click event. 

**Thoughts:** Syntax and remembering the commands will be the biggest hurdle. I remembered using [] to define arrays but I don't recall using const before variables. Maybe it's been too long. Maybe I'm just too used to VEX
